Public-key encryption is a type of asymmetric cryptology where the encryption and decryption processes require different keys. There are two main components in public-key encryption: the public key and the private key.

The public key does not need to be protected. You can place it out on the public internet. The public key must be used to encrypt the data.

The private key must be protected. The private key is the only way to decrypt the data. The public key cannot be used to decrypt the data.

Enjoy!
